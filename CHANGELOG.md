### Warning

_The following warnings will appear when running the installation command, but they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product (they will be solved in our next update):_

```
npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm WARN deprecated har-validator@5.1.5: this library is no longer supported
npm WARN react-event-listener@0.6.6 requires a peer of react@^16.3.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
```

_If they will persist in our 2.*.* version, we will drop their usages and replace them with other plugins._
_In development mode, some of the above plugins will throw a warning because they still use React v16 syntax. If the error will persist in our 2.*.* version, we will drop their usage and replace them with other plugins._

**Note:** There are 6 vulnerabilities when running the `npm install` command, to fix it just run the following command `npm audit fix` once the installation is finished.

## [1.9.0] 27.05.2020

### Bug fixing

- Add `React.useEffect` inside `src/views/Pages/LoginPage.js` and `src/views/Pages/LockScreenPage.js` so that the `setTimeout` will not throw errors on route change
- https://github.com/creativetimofficial/ct-material-dashboard-pro-react/issues/219 (added two new props for this component, so you can easily use your own default value and your own function for changing this value)

## [1.8.0] 2019-08-26

### Warning

- Wizard and Wizard Steps were not changed to hooks since we need to be able to call the isValidated function (this can only be achieved with classes - withStyles function is still being used)
- Sidebar Component could not be changed to hooks due to the dynamic nature of this component (the collapses states are done dynamically, and you do not have anyway of knowing the amount of collapses this component will have to create static states - withStyles function is still being used)

### Bug fixing

- Rewrote the ISSUE_TEMPLATE
- Deleted the copyright comments from all files, we only need to keep them inside our index.js and index.html
- Added script that adds copyrights to the built app
- Renamed all the files from `.jsx` to `.js`
- Changed the `withStyles` function from Material-UI with the `makeStyles` function (integration with other frameworks should now be easy)
- React Hooks is now supported (Please read the above warnings)

### Major style changes

- `src/assets/jss/material-dashboard-pro-react/components/customDropdownStyle.js`

- Run `prettier` (minor code writting bugs)
- Added lint commands (please read the live docs)
- Added back the `helpText` prop on `CustomInput` component (if the `CustomInput` has the `error` prop set, the `helpText` wil have error color, if the `success` prop is set on `CustomInput` then the `helpText` will have success color)
- Deleted the `Clear` (icon that appeared on `error` for `CustomInput`) and `Check` (icon that appeared on `success` for `CustomInput`) - now you should use `InputAdornment` from `@material-ui/core`
- Changed `CustomDropdown`, now it uses `@material-ui/core/Popper`, instead of `{ Manager, Target, Popper }` from `react-popper`
- Changed the dropdown link in `HeaderLinks`, now it uses `@material-ui/core/Popper`, instead of `{ Manager, Target, Popper }` from `react-popper`
